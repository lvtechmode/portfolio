<h3>About Liberty</h3>
<p>A lot of my technical experience is through the pharmacy industry. As a pharmacy technican, I have always been more interested in the technologies
 that help manage and improve health. I have past experiences building personal web pages for friends and family just for fun. Building webpages have allowed me to expand my creativity and I've always wanted to make it a career.
</p>

<p>As a start, I recently earned a Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering at Colorado Technical University in 2020. I am now a student at <a href="http://www.thinkful.com" target="new_win">Thinkful</a>. 
With Thinkful, I am acquiring the programming knowledge needed to enrich my skills. It's exciting to finally be on this journey of continuous learning and innovation through development.</p>

<p>My interests include:
<ul>
<li>Clean Coding techniques.</li>
<li>Modern and innovative designs that improve business and User Experience.</li>
<li>Collaborating with talented developers.</li>
</p>
</ul>


<p>Have a look around my website. I believe in creating quality content with an impact. When you are ready, let's collaborate! <a href="mailto: lvtechmode@gmail.com">Contact Me</a>.</p>
